Level 1: Storage Profile Basics
Profile Explorer: Write a simple script that reads the profiles.json file and prints out all available profiles with their storage types and file paths.
Profile Creator: Create a command-line tool that lets you create a new profile by specifying a name and optional storage type (defaulting to JSON).
Profile Validator: Write a tool that validates all profiles in profiles.json by checking if their referenced storage files exist and are valid JSON.

Level 2: Storage Interaction
Data Peeker: Create a utility that lets you peek at the data stored in a profile without loading the entire dataset. Show summary statistics like number of sessions, tests, and date range.
Profile Switcher: Build a tool that lets you copy test data from one profile to another, effectively "switching" profiles for a dataset.
Profile Backup: Implement a backup system for profiles.json that creates timestamped backups before any modifications.

Level 3: Advanced Storage Management
Profile Merger: Create a utility that can merge data from multiple profiles into a new profile, handling duplicate sessions appropriately.
Storage Migration: Build a tool that can migrate a profile from one storage type to another (e.g., from JSON to SQLite).
Profile Recovery: Implement a recovery system that can scan the ~/.pytest_insight directory for orphaned data files and recreate profiles.json entries for them.

Level 4: Integration Challenges
Custom Storage Backend: Implement a new storage backend (e.g., MongoDB or Redis) and integrate it with the profile system.
Profile Synchronization: Create a system that can synchronize profiles between different machines using a shared location.
Profile Analytics Dashboard: Build a simple web dashboard that shows statistics about all your profiles, their sizes, and usage patterns.

Level 5: Master Challenges
Distributed Profile System: Design and implement a distributed profile system that allows multiple users to share and collaborate on test data.
Profile Version Control: Implement a version control system for profiles that tracks changes and allows reverting to previous states.
Profile Migration Framework: Create a framework for defining and executing complex migrations between different profile schemas as the pytest-insight data model evolves.
