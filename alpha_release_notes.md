pytest-insight Unified Experience Roadmap

Phase 1: Audit & Assessment
Inventory all interfaces: CLI, Streamlit dashboard, FastAPI/Swagger, HTML reports, terminal output, config files.
Catalog terminology: Identify inconsistencies in naming (e.g., SUT, profile, project, etc.).
Map feature overlap: Note where similar analyses/insights are presented differently.
Phase 2: Core Engine Refactor
Centralize insight logic: Refactor so all interfaces (CLI, dashboard, API, terminal summary) call the same analysis/insight engine.
Standardize output schemas: Define a universal data structure for health, stability, impact, etc., used everywhere.
Unify terminology: Update code, docs, and UI to use consistent names for concepts.
Phase 3: Interface Alignment
Terminal Output:
Make terminal summary output (pytest plugin) use the same “cards”/sections as dashboard and CLI.
Add links or hints to dashboard/API in terminal output for discoverability.
CLI:
Add a “start here” command that summarizes health, launches dashboard, and prints API/report links.
Ensure CLI analyses match dashboard structure.
Dashboard:
Reuse the same summary/insight sections as CLI/terminal.
Add configuration UI for TOML options.
API/Swagger:
Ensure API endpoints return the same insight objects.
Link to dashboard and docs from Swagger UI.
HTML Reports:
Generate from the same templates/components as dashboard where possible.
Phase 4: User Experience & Design
Design system: Create a shared style guide for colors, icons, and layout (as much as possible across Streamlit, HTML, and CLI).
Glossary & onboarding: Add a glossary and “How to use pytest-insight” quickstart to all interfaces.
Feedback loop: Add a way for users to give feedback from any interface.
Phase 5: Documentation & Communication
Update documentation: Reflect unified concepts and flows.
Communicate the unified vision: Blog post, release notes, and in-tool messages.
What’s a “Vision Doc”?
A vision doc is a short, inspiring document that answers:

What is pytest-insight’s “north star”?
What problem does it solve for users?
What should every user feel or achieve after using it?
What are the core principles of the experience?
It’s a touchstone for the team and users, used to guide decisions and keep everyone aligned.

Example “Vision Doc” for pytest-insight
pytest-insight Vision
pytest-insight empowers every developer and team to understand, improve, and trust their test suites—no matter how complex.

Our unified engine delivers actionable insights at every touchpoint: the CLI, dashboard, API, reports, and even the terminal.

Consistent, clear, and actionable: Whether you’re running a quick test, digging into a dashboard, or automating with our API, you’ll see the same health metrics, stability trends, and recommendations—always up to date, always in your language.

Accessible to all: From the first-time contributor to the test architect, pytest-insight meets you where you are, guiding you to better quality and faster delivery.

One engine, many views. One goal: Insightful testing.

Absolutely, here’s a candid assessment of pytest-insight’s readiness for an Alpha release, based on your project’s current state, design, and recent changes:

Strengths & Alpha-Ready Aspects
Modern Architecture & API Design
The project is well-architected with a clear separation of concerns (Core API, REST API, CLI, Dashboard).
The fluent interface and storage profile system are forward-looking and developer-friendly.
Robust Storage Profile System
The move to a profile-only storage approach (with user, timestamp, and metadata tracking) is a strong foundation for both local and CI/CD/cloud use cases.
Backward compatibility and migration handling are in place.
Comprehensive CLI
The unified insight command with subcommands (profile, analyze, generate, etc.) is intuitive and well-documented.
Typer-based CLI with consistent help/option conventions.
Advanced Analysis & Insights
Rich set of metrics and insights (health, stability, impact, etc.).
Predictive analytics and impact analysis features are in place.
Interactive Dashboard
Streamlit dashboard provides a user-friendly entry point for non-technical users.
Extensible & Maintainable Codebase
Logical directory structure, clear separation between core and web API, and adherence to PEP8 and best practices.
Good Backward Compatibility & Migration Handling
Handles legacy profiles, missing fields, and migration scenarios gracefully.
Areas to Address Before Alpha Release
1. Documentation & Onboarding
README & CLI Guide: Ensure the README and CLI documentation are fully up-to-date, especially after recent CLI and API changes.
Quickstart Guide: Add a minimal “getting started” section for new users (install, create profile, analyze data).
API Reference: Document the core API and REST endpoints, especially any dynamic or introspected endpoints.
2. Test Coverage & Quality
Unit & Integration Tests:
Ensure all new features (especially storage profiles, predictive analytics, and web API introspection) are covered.
Address the noted gap: create tests for the introspected API (test_web_api_introspect.py).
End-to-End Tests: Add tests for common user workflows (profile creation, data generation, analysis, dashboard launch).
CI/CD: Set up or verify automated testing in your preferred CI environment.
3. Error Handling & User Feedback
CLI and API Error Messages: Review for clarity and helpfulness, especially for common misconfigurations (missing profiles, bad paths, etc.).
Web API Robustness: Ensure all endpoints handle edge cases and return meaningful error messages.
4. Usability & UX Polish
Dashboard Polish:
Ensure the Streamlit dashboard is visually appealing and responsive.
Add tooltips/help for complex metrics.
CLI UX: Confirm that all commands are discoverable and that option/argument validation is robust.
5. Dependency & Environment Management
Requirements: Ensure requirements.txt and pyproject.toml are up-to-date and minimal.
UV Usage: Confirm that all documentation and scripts use uv for dependency management.
6. Backward Compatibility & Migration
Profile Migration: Provide a migration script or clear instructions for users with old-style storage configs.
Legacy Data: Test loading and analyzing legacy test session data.
7. Security & Privacy
Sensitive Data: Review for any unintentional exposure of user/environment data in logs or outputs.
Cloud Storage: If supporting cloud providers, ensure authentication and credential handling are secure.
8. Release Engineering
Versioning: Set a clear version (e.g., 0.1.0a1) and changelog for the Alpha.
Distribution: Ensure installability via PyPI or direct source, with clear instructions.
Feedback Channels: Set up a way for early users to report issues (GitHub Issues, email, etc.).
Summary Table
| Area | Status | Action Needed Before Alpha? | |-----------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------| | Core API & CLI | Strong | Minor polish, doc updates | | Storage Profile System | Robust | Test migration, doc clarity | | Analysis & Insights | Advanced | Doc/test new metrics, polish UX | | Dashboard | Functional | Polish visuals, add help | | Web API | Good, dynamic | Add introspect API tests | | Test Coverage | Good, some gaps | Add missing tests, CI integration | | Docs & Onboarding | Improving | Add quickstart, update all docs | | Security/Privacy | Acceptable | Review cloud/auth handling | | Release Engineering | Prepped | Version, changelog, feedback setup |

### Unreliable Test Terminology Replaced

All references to "flaky", "flakiness", and "flaky_tests" have been replaced with "unreliable", "reliability", and "unreliable_tests" throughout the codebase, documentation, dashboards, and tests. This change improves clarity and consistency in metrics, insights, and user experience.

**Old:**
  - Flaky, Flakiness, Flaky Tests, Flaky Rate
**New:**
  - Unreliable, Reliability, Unreliable Tests, Reliability Rate

#### Impact

* API endpoints, CLI, and dashboards use new terminology
* Test assertions and recommendations updated
* Documentation and guides updated

#### Migration Notes

* Users should update any scripts or integrations that reference the old terminology

#### Example CLI Output

Old: `Flaky Rate: 7.5% | Most Flaky: test_module.py::test_flaky`
New: `Reliability Rate: 92.5% | Most Unreliable: test_module.py::test_unreliable`

Final Thoughts
You are in a strong position for an Alpha release! The foundation is robust, and the architecture is modern and extensible. The main work before Alpha is:

Tightening up docs and onboarding
Filling test coverage gaps
Polishing UX and error handling
None of these are major blockers, but addressing them will ensure a smooth Alpha experience for early adopters and help you gather useful feedback.
