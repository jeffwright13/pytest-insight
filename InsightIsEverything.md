if you treat everything as an “Insight,” and make the InsightAPI the single, unified entry point, you can present a spectrum of insights spanning from the most granular (single session/test) to the most abstract (trends, comparisons, predictions). This would make the system more discoverable, less deterministic, and more user-intuitive, while still retaining the composability you love in the Query system.

High-Level Redesign Proposal: “Everything is an Insight”
1. InsightAPI as the Sole Entry Point
•	All analytics, queries, comparisons, and reports are accessed via InsightAPI.
•	The API exposes a set of “insight types” or “lenses” (e.g., Session, Test, Temporal, Comparative, Trend, Predictive).
2. Insight Types / Lenses
•	Each insight type corresponds to a way of looking at the data:
•	Session Insight: Metrics and health for a single session or group of sessions.
•	Test Insight: Focus on individual tests, their flakiness, reliability, etc.
•	Temporal Insight: How things change over time (trends, regressions, improvements).
•	Comparative Insight: Compare across SUTs, code versions, environments, etc.
•	Trend Insight: Detect and highlight emerging patterns.
•	Predictive Insight: Machine learning-driven forecasts or anomaly detection.
•	Meta Insight: Insights about the test process itself (e.g., maintenance burden, stability over time).
3. Fluent, Composable API
•	Users can compose queries and then “ask for” a particular insight:
```python
api = InsightAPI(profile="myprofile")
api.session("2025-04-16").insight("health")
api.tests().filter(name="test_login").insight("flakiness")
api.sut("serviceA").over_time(days=30).insight("trend")
api.compare(sut="A", sut="B").insight("regression")
```
4. Discoverable, Extensible, Intuitive
•	All capabilities are discoverable from the single API.
•	New insight types can be added as new “lenses” or methods.
•	The user doesn’t have to know up front if they want “analysis,” “comparison,” or “trend”—they just ask for an insight on the data they care about.
•	We do not use the word "flaky" because that is reserved for the pytet-rerunfailures plugin. Instead we use the related words "reliable", "unreliable", "reliability", etc.







Assessment:

1. InsightAPI as the Sole Entry Point
Current State:
The InsightAPI is already the main entry point for most analytics, queries, and reports in your system.
However, not all analytics/reporting logic is consistently routed through InsightAPI (some CLI, dashboard, or HTML output may still call lower-level functions directly).
Gap:
Some analytics, trends, and summaries are not yet fully unified under InsightAPI (see your “What’s Left To Do” memory).
2. Insight Types / Lenses
Current State:
The API and UI expose session-level and test-level queries, and some higher-level analytics (summary, trends).
There is partial support for comparative and temporal insights, but these are not always discoverable as “lenses.”
Gap:
Not all insight types are formalized as first-class “lenses.”
Predictive, meta, and trend insights are not yet fully exposed as composable, discoverable methods.
3. Fluent, Composable API
Current State:
The query system is highly composable and fluent (e.g., .filter_by_test().with_duration().apply().execute()).
However, the “.insight(…)” pattern is not yet fully implemented; users must sometimes know which analysis/reporting method to call.
Gap:
The universal .insight("type") pattern is not yet available for all insight types.
Some methods still require the user to know specific method names rather than composing insights generically.
4. Discoverable, Extensible, Intuitive
Current State:
The API Explorer UI is moving toward dynamic introspection, grouping, and discoverability.
Method grouping and categorization are now available in the UI.
Gap:
The full spectrum of insights is not yet discoverable from a single root (InsightAPI).
Some insight types are hidden behind specific method names or not yet exposed at all.
The system could be more intuitive if all analytics, trends, and comparisons were discoverable as .insight("type") or similar.

| Tenet | Current Status | Gaps/Next Steps | |-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------| | InsightAPI as Sole Entry | 80% there | Standardize all analytics via InsightAPI| | Insight Types/Lenses | Partially present | Formalize all as discoverable lenses | | Fluent, Composable API | Fluent query present | Implement universal .insight() | | Discoverable, Extensible, Intuitive | Improving | Make all insights discoverable |

Recommendations & Next Steps
Standardize Analytics API
Ensure all analytics/reporting logic is accessible via InsightAPI (see your “What’s Left To Do” memory).
Move or wrap all analysis methods so they are available as .insight("type") or similar.
Formalize Insight Types as Lenses
Create a registry or enumeration of available insight types.
Expose them via .insight("type"), e.g., .insight("trend"), .insight("reliability").
Refactor Output Formatting
Separate data generation (via InsightAPI) from formatting (CLI, HTML, dashboard).
Ensure all output consumers use the standardized API.
Enhance UI Discoverability
Make all insight types and lenses visible and selectable in the API Explorer UI.
Provide descriptions and sample outputs for each insight type.
Document the Unified Model
Update documentation to reflect the “Everything is an Insight” philosophy.
Provide examples for each lens/type.
Merits of This Approach
Discoverability: All analytics are accessible from one place.
Extensibility: New insight types are easy to add.
Composability: Fluent, chainable API remains intact.
User Intuitiveness: Users don’t need to know internal details; they just “ask for an insight.”

Conclusion:
You are well on your way to achieving the “Everything is an Insight” vision. The major remaining work is to standardize all analytics under InsightAPI, formalize discoverable insight types/lenses, and ensure all output and UI routes through this unified, discoverable API.
