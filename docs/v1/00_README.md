# ðŸš¦ Project Status: On Hiatus (as of 2025-05-02)

**This project is currently paused.**

- The codebase is in an exploratory, partially complete state.
- Many features are present, but some are unfinished or experimental.
- This document and others in `/docs/v1/` have been updated for future contributors.

## ðŸ§­ Guide for Future Contributors / Maintainers

**If you're picking this up for the first time:**

1. **Read this file fully.**
2. **Review the following in order:**
   - [01_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK.md](./01_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK.md): Design philosophy and layers
   - [02_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./02_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md): Technical architecture
   - [03_STORAGE.md](./03_STORAGE.md): Storage/profile system
   - [04_CLI_GUIDE.md](./04_CLI_GUIDE.md): CLI usage

**Project Highlights:**
- Fluent, chainable API for querying, comparing, and analyzing pytest data
- Storage profile system for flexible data management (see `core/storage.py`)
- Interactive CLI and Streamlit dashboard
- Predictive analytics and advanced test health metrics

**Whatâ€™s Incomplete or Experimental:**
- Some analysis and insights features are stubs or prototypes
- REST API is not fully unified with Python API (see `/web_api`)
- Dashboard is functional but not fully polished
- Some advanced metrics and federated analysis are planned but not implemented

## ðŸ“Œ State of the Project / Next Steps

- Most architectural decisions are documented in [01_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK.md](./01_CONCEPTUAL_FRAMEWORK.md) and [02_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](./02_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md).
- Open questions and roadmap ideas are at the end of major docs.
- See `README.md` in the project root for a quick summary and contact info.
