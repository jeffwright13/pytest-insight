# Pytest Insight - Available Metrics and Reports

This document catalogs the various metrics, reports, and insights that can be generated by pytest-insight. Each report type is designed to help teams understand test behavior patterns and optimize their testing strategy.

## Currently Implemented

### Time-Based Analysis
- **Duration Trends** - How test execution times evolve across sessions
- **Failure Trends** - Patterns in test failures over multiple sessions
- **Emerging Patterns** - New or changing patterns in test behavior

## Planned/Potential Reports

### Performance Metrics
- **Slowest Tests Ranking** - Tests ranked by average or most recent execution time
- **Test Duration Evolution** - How individual test duration changes over time (plotted as time series)
- **Performance Anomaly Detection** - Tests that suddenly take much longer/shorter to run
- **Seasonal Performance Patterns** - Time-based patterns in test performance (e.g., day of week effects)

### Reliability Metrics
- **Top Flaky Tests** - Tests ranked by flakiness (inconsistent pass/fail)
- **Flakiness Score** - Percentage measure of how often a test's result differs from previous run
- **Mean Time Between Failures** - Average time/runs between failures for specific tests
- **Failure Rate by Test** - Percentage of runs where a test fails
- **Correlated Test Failures** - Tests that tend to fail together (suggesting common dependencies)
- **Flakiness Trends** - How test reliability changes over time

### Resource Utilization
- **Memory Usage Patterns** - If captured, memory consumption trends during test execution
- **CPU Utilization** - Processor usage patterns during testing
- **I/O Impact** - Tests with significant disk/network operations

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **Coverage Trends** - How code coverage metrics change over time
- **Coverage vs Duration** - Correlation between test coverage and execution time
- **Coverage Gaps** - Areas of code with insufficient test coverage

### Dependency Analysis
- **Test Dependency Graph** - Visual representation of test interdependencies
- **Fragile Fixture Detection** - Fixtures that frequently cause test failures
- **Shared Resource Conflicts** - Tests competing for the same resources

### CI/CD Integration Insights
- **Optimal Test Order** - Suggested execution order to detect failures faster
- **Test Suite Health Score** - Overall rating of the test suite's reliability
- **Hotspot Detection** - Code areas frequently involved in test failures
- **Build Integration Analysis** - Test performance in CI/CD pipeline context

### Team Productivity
- **Test Maintenance Burden** - Tests requiring frequent updates
- **Test Value Score** - Tests ranked by how often they catch issues
- **Developer Impact** - How code changes by specific developers affect test outcomes

## Custom Reporting

All metrics can be filtered by:
- System Under Test (SUT)
- Test node ID
- Time period
- Test outcome

Reports can be generated in multiple formats:
- JSON/dictionary data for custom processing
- Human-readable text summaries
- Exportable data for visualization in external tools
