 Maintaining a clear separation between the low-level introspective API and the higher-level functionality makes perfect sense. This aligns well with good software design principles and the existing architecture of pytest-insight.

Here's a refined approach that maintains this separation:

Two-Tier API Architecture
1. Lower Tier: Core Introspective API
Provides a direct, thin wrapper around Query-Compare-Analyze-Insight (Q-C-A-I)
Exposes all methods and parameters from the core API
Serves as a stable foundation for building higher-level functionality
Follows a consistent, predictable pattern for endpoint generation
2. Higher Tier: Specialized Endpoints & UI
Built on top of the core introspective API
Provides "canned" reports and specialized endpoints for common use cases
Includes UI components (dashboard, generator, selector)
Handles Grafana integration and other external system connections
Implementation Strategy
Instead of merging the APIs into a single module, we can:

Refine the introspective API (web_api_introspect.py) to ensure it's complete and well-tested
Refactor the original web API (web_api.py) to use the introspective API as its foundation
Create a unified entry point that mounts both tiers while maintaining their separation
This approach gives users:

Direct access to the complete Q-C-A-I functionality via the introspective API
Convenient access to common use cases via the higher-level endpoints
A clear understanding of which tier they're using

Main App Assembly
The unified entry point would:

Create the core introspective API app
Mount the higher-level endpoints on separate routes
Mount the UI components
Configure middleware, documentation, etc.
This maintains a clean separation of concerns while providing a unified experience for users. It also makes testing and maintenance easier since each component has a clear responsibility.



Here's a summary of the architecture:

1. Core Python API (Existing)
The foundation: Query-Compare-Analyze-Insight (Q-C-A-I)
Well-tested, feature-complete Python methods
Provides the full Query/Filter system with fluent interface
Used directly by Python developers for maximum flexibility
2. Introspective API (To Enhance)
A thin REST wrapper around the core Python API
Automatically generated from the Python API via introspection
Exposes all methods and parameters from the core API
Provides a stable foundation for building higher-level functionality
Accessed via FastAPI endpoints
3. Higher-Level API (To Build)
Built on top of the introspective API
Provides "canned" reports and specialized endpoints for common use cases
Offers pre-built insights, metrics, and visualizations
Handles common workflows like comparing SUTs or analyzing trends
Also accessed via FastAPI endpoints
4. User Interfaces (Reference Implementations)
Various interfaces built on top of either API tier:
CLI tools for command-line usage
TUI (Text User Interface) for terminal-based dashboards
GUI applications for desktop usage
Web dashboards for browser-based visualization
PWAs for installable web applications
This multi-tiered approach gives users the flexibility to work at whatever level of abstraction makes sense for their needs:

Power users can use the core Python API directly
Developers can use the introspective API for custom integrations
Most users can rely on the higher-level API for day-to-day needs
Everyone can benefit from the reference UI implementations
It's a very well-structured approach that maintains separation of concerns while providing multiple entry points for different types of users and use cases.
