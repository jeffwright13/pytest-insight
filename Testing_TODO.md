## Filters Module
1. Basic Filter Tests
   - [ ] Basic initialization of TestFilter
   - [ ] Simple SUT filtering
   - [ ] Date range filtering
   - [ ] Test outcome filtering
   - [ ] Warning presence filtering
   - [ ] Rerun presence filtering
   - [ ] Node ID pattern matching

2. Integration Filter Tests
   - [ ] Multiple filter combinations
   - [ ] Filter application to test sessions
   - [ ] Filter application to test results
   - [ ] Edge cases (empty results, invalid filters)

## Compare Module
1. Basic Comparison Tests
   - [ ] Session comparison basics
   - [ ] Test result comparison
   - [ ] Duration comparisons
   - [ ] Outcome changes

2. Advanced Comparison Tests
   - [ ] Pattern detection
   - [ ] Trend analysis
   - [ ] Historical comparisons
   - [ ] Statistical analysis

Would you like to start with the basic filter tests? We can:
1. Look at current filter code
2. Design first test case
3. Get your approval before implementing
4. Repeat process for each test case

Which would you prefer to tackle first?# pytest-insight Testing TODO
