Single test metris:
Avg duration
Pct P/F/R

Single tests over time:
Continuously failing tests (how many in arow; can have a param that specifies number allowable passes i between failures to still consider 'consecutive')
Recently behaving tests (had been failing, now passing)
Recently misbehaving tests (had been passing, now failing)
Flaky tests (pass after N reruns)

Multiple tests:
co-failures (clusters of 2, 3, 4... tests that tend to fail together)

Health Report
Stability report

Stats:
P/F(XF is considered P; XP is considered F)/Rerun/Warn/Err
  numbers and percentages

Avail for: All sessions / Last N sessions / between X and Y sessions ago / Date range / only suts in list /

We want to build an interactive UI of some sort that allows loading of profile[s] (so as to get a colection of TestSessions to analyze); creation of new queries; display of stats based on those querie responses (essentially list of sessions); comparison
