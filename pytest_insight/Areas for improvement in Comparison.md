Current Structure of the Comparison System
The Comparison class is designed to compare test sessions by:

Building queries for base and target sessions
Filtering sessions by various criteria (SUT, date, test patterns, etc.)
Executing the comparison to produce a ComparisonResult with categorized differences
Issues and Concerns
Rigid Session ID Requirements:
The code enforces that base sessions must have IDs starting with "base-" and target sessions with "target-"
This seems unnecessarily restrictive and doesn't align with the Simple File Exchange feature we just implemented
Limited Comparison Options:
The comparison is primarily designed for comparing two specific sessions
There's no easy way to compare groups of sessions or aggregate results
Performance Threshold Hardcoding:
The performance regression detection uses hardcoded 20% thresholds (slower/faster)
This should be configurable
Query Integration:
While the class uses Query objects internally, it doesn't fully leverage the Query capabilities we've built
Error Handling:
The error messages are not very descriptive or user-friendly
There's no graceful handling of edge cases (e.g., empty sessions)
Potential Improvements
Flexible Session Identification:
Remove the strict "base-" and "target-" prefix requirements
Allow users to specify their own criteria for base vs. target sessions
Enhanced Comparison Options:
Add support for comparing session groups (e.g., all sessions from last week vs. this week)
Implement aggregation methods for group comparisons
Configurable Thresholds:
Make performance thresholds configurable (e.g., with_performance_threshold(percent=20))
Allow different thresholds for different test types
Better Query Integration:
Fully leverage the Query system's capabilities
Allow direct passing of Query objects for more complex filtering
Improved Error Handling:
More descriptive error messages
Graceful handling of edge cases


A critical issue - the Comparison class is duplicating much of the functionality already present in the Query class. This creates several problems:

Code Duplication: Methods like in_last_days, with_test_pattern, and with_duration_threshold are essentially wrappers around Query methods
Maintenance Burden: Any changes to Query filtering logic would need to be replicated in Comparison
Inconsistency Risk: The implementations might drift apart over time, leading to subtle bugs
Violation of DRY Principle: (Don't Repeat Yourself) - a fundamental software engineering principle
Let's look at how we can refactor this to better leverage the existing Query class:

Current Approach
Currently, Comparison creates two Query objects and then implements its own methods that:

Call similar methods on both Query objects
Return self for method chaining
python
CopyInsert
def in_last_days(self, days: int) -> "Comparison":
    self._base_query.in_last_days(days)
    self._target_query.in_last_days(days)
    return self
Better Approach
Instead of duplicating Query methods, Comparison should:

Expose the base and target Query objects directly
Provide a minimal set of methods specific to comparison operations
Allow direct configuration of the underlying Query objects
Here's how we could refactor this:

Expose Query Objects: Allow direct access to the underlying Query objects
Comparison-Specific Methods: Keep only methods that are truly specific to comparison (like between_suts)
Fluent Configuration: Provide a fluent way to configure both queries at once when needed
This approach would:

Eliminate code duplication
Ensure consistency with Query behavior
Make the API more flexible and powerful
Reduce maintenance burden
