# pytest-insight Analysis Optimization TODOs

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] **Implement parallel processing** for analysis methods using `concurrent.futures` to speed up processing of large datasets
- [ ] **Add caching mechanisms** for frequently accessed data to reduce repeated calculations
- [ ] **Optimize memory usage** in the stability analysis by processing test results in smaller batches
- [ ] **Implement incremental analysis** to only process new sessions since the last analysis

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Add statistical significance tests** for trend analysis to provide more accurate insights
- [ ] **Implement machine learning models** for anomaly detection in test results
- [ ] **Add correlation analysis** between test failures to identify related failures
- [ ] **Enhance visualization options** for analysis results (e.g., charts, graphs)
- [ ] **Add export functionality** for analysis results in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)

## Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] **Complete linting fixes** across the codebase, particularly in storage.py
- [ ] **Add comprehensive type hints** to improve code maintainability
- [ ] **Refactor analysis methods** to reduce code duplication
- [ ] **Improve error handling** with more specific exception types and better error messages

## User Experience

- [ ] **Add configurable thresholds** for flakiness detection and trend analysis
- [ ] **Implement interactive mode** for analysis with real-time updates
- [ ] **Add more detailed progress reporting** with estimated time remaining
- [ ] **Improve CLI output formatting** for better readability
- [ ] **Add support for custom analysis plugins** to extend functionality

## Testing and Documentation

- [ ] **Add unit tests** for all analysis methods
- [ ] **Create performance benchmarks** to measure optimization improvements
- [ ] **Update documentation** with examples of analysis output and interpretation
- [ ] **Add tutorials** for common analysis workflows

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Fix the remaining lint issues** in storage.py:
   - Import block formatting at line 612
   - Unused yaml import
   - Redundant conditional at line 1092
- [ ] **Review and optimize** the JSON streaming implementation for large files
- [ ] **Standardize progress reporting** across all components
