# pytest-insight Analysis Optimization TODOs

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] **Implement parallel processing** for analysis methods using `concurrent.futures` to speed up processing of large datasets
- [ ] **Add caching mechanisms** for frequently accessed data to reduce repeated calculations
- [ ] **Optimize memory usage** in the stability analysis by processing test results in smaller batches
- [ ] **Implement incremental analysis** to only process new sessions since the last analysis

## Feature Enhancements

- [ ] **Add statistical significance tests** for trend analysis to provide more accurate insights
- [ ] **Implement machine learning models** for anomaly detection in test results
- [ ] **Add correlation analysis** between test failures to identify related failures
- [ ] **Enhance visualization options** for analysis results (e.g., charts, graphs)
- [ ] **Add export functionality** for analysis results in various formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)

## Code Quality Improvements

- [ ] **Complete linting fixes** across the codebase, particularly in storage.py
- [ ] **Add comprehensive type hints** to improve code maintainability
- [ ] **Refactor analysis methods** to reduce code duplication
- [ ] **Improve error handling** with more specific exception types and better error messages

## User Experience

- [ ] **Add configurable thresholds** for flakiness detection and trend analysis
- [ ] **Implement interactive mode** for analysis with real-time updates
- [ ] **Add more detailed progress reporting** with estimated time remaining
- [ ] **Improve CLI output formatting** for better readability
- [ ] **Add support for custom analysis plugins** to extend functionality

## Testing and Documentation

- [ ] **Add unit tests** for all analysis methods
- [ ] **Create performance benchmarks** to measure optimization improvements
- [ ] **Update documentation** with examples of analysis output and interpretation
- [ ] **Add tutorials** for common analysis workflows

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Fix the remaining lint issues** in storage.py:
   - Import block formatting at line 612
   - Unused yaml import
   - Redundant conditional at line 1092
- [ ] **Review and optimize** the JSON streaming implementation for large files
- [ ] **Standardize progress reporting** across all components



Based on the current comprehensive analysis output and comparing it with the features mentioned in your memories, here are several valuable analyses that are missing and worth implementing:

1. Predictive Analytics Features
From your memory, you've implemented predictive analytics but they're not showing in the comprehensive analysis:

Failure Prediction: Predict which tests are likely to fail in future runs based on historical patterns
Anomaly Detection: Identify tests with unusual behavior patterns that might indicate underlying issues
Stability Forecasting: Project future test stability trends based on current patterns
2. Test Impact Analysis
Your memory indicates you've implemented test impact analysis features that aren't appearing in the comprehensive output:

Criticality Scoring: Identify high-impact tests based on failure rate, dependencies, execution frequency, and duration
Correlation Matrix Visualization: Show which tests tend to fail together in a visual format
Co-failing Test Group Detection: While you have co-failures, you could enhance this with more detailed group detection
3. Failure Pattern Analysis
These features from your memory would provide deeper insights:

Error Message Pattern Detection: Identify common types of failures by analyzing error messages
Stack Trace Analysis: Pinpoint problematic code locations by analyzing stack traces
Temporal Pattern Analysis: Detect time-based failure trends (e.g., failures that occur at specific times)
4. Additional Valuable Analyses
These would complement your existing analyses:

Test Execution Time Trends: Show how test execution times have changed over time
Test Maintenance Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis
Test Coverage Analysis: Analyze which parts of the codebase are well-tested vs. undertested
Test Dependency Graph: Visualize dependencies between tests to understand cascading failures
Test Suite Efficiency Metrics: Analyze the efficiency of your test suite (e.g., redundancy, coverage per execution time)
Behavior Changes Analysis: Highlight tests that have recently changed behavior (passing to failing or vice versa)
Implementation Priority
Based on your CLI-first approach, I'd recommend implementing these features in this order:

Behavior Changes Analysis - This is relatively straightforward and provides immediate value
Error Message Pattern Detection - Helps identify common failure patterns
Test Execution Time Trends - Useful for performance optimization
Criticality Scoring - Helps teams focus on the most important tests
Predictive Analytics Features - These provide forward-looking insights
Each of these would need to be implemented in the core analysis.py file and then exposed through the CLI interface in main.py. The dashboard integration could follow once you've validated the usefulness of these features through the CLI.

Would you like me to help implement any of these specific analyses?
