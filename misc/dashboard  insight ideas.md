glad to hear the dashboard is working now! You're absolutely right that it needs more valuable insights and metrics to provide real value. Based on the codebase we've been working with, here are some suggestions for enhancing the dashboard with more meaningful insights:

Potential Dashboard Enhancements:
Test Execution Trends
Historical pass/fail rates over time with trend lines
Test execution time trends to identify performance regressions
Flakiness index for tests over multiple runs

Test Impact Analysis
Identify which tests are most critical to your system
Show correlation between test failures and specific code areas
Highlight tests that frequently fail together (suggesting related issues)

Test Coverage Insights
Integration with coverage data to show which tests cover important code paths
Identify areas with insufficient test coverage

Failure Pattern Analysis
Cluster similar failures to identify common root causes
Show stack trace patterns across multiple failures
Suggest potential fixes based on historical data

CI/CD Integration
Correlate test results with specific builds or deployments
Show impact of code changes on test stability

Custom Dashboards
Allow users to create custom views for specific teams or concerns
Save and share dashboard configurations

Would you like me to help implement any of these specific enhancements to make the dashboard more valuable? I can focus on one or two areas to start with that would provide the most immediate value.
