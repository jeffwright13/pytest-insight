Let me analyze what needs to be done to make the Comparison component more robust and full-featured in pytest-insight.
Current Comparison API Status
Based on the memories and context, the Comparison API currently has basic functionality but needs enhancement to be as robust as the Query component. Let's break down what's needed:
1. Core Comparison Functionality Enhancements
1.	Session Identification Improvements
•	The current implementation relies on session ID patterns to distinguish base from target sessions
•	Need more reliable methods to identify corresponding test runs across versions
•	Should support automatic matching based on timestamps, tags, or other metadata
2.	Comparison Categories Expansion
•	Current categories include new failures, fixed tests, and flaky tests
•	Need to add more categories like:
•	Performance regressions (tests that became slower)
•	Performance improvements (tests that became faster)
•	Warning changes (new warnings, fixed warnings)
•	Test stability metrics (flakiness score)
3.	Multi-Version Comparison
•	Support comparing more than two versions at once
•	Track trends across multiple versions/runs
•	Provide historical context for test behavior
2. Filtering and Analysis Enhancements
1.	Combined Filtering
•	Allow filtering on both base and target sessions with different criteria
•	Support complex queries like "tests that failed in target but passed in base AND took longer than 5 seconds"
2.	Statistical Analysis
•	Add statistical significance testing for duration changes
•	Calculate confidence intervals for flakiness metrics
•	Provide trend analysis for test stability over time
3.	Categorization Improvements
•	Handle tests that belong to multiple categories (e.g., both flaky and slow)
•	Provide weighted scoring for test issues
•	Support custom categorization rules
3. API Design and Interface
1.	Fluent Interface
•	Implement a consistent fluent interface similar to Query
•	Methods should chain naturally and be self-descriptive
•	Example:
python
CopyInsert
comparison.between_suts("base-sut", "target-sut")
    .with_session_id_pattern("base-*", "target-*")
    .in_last_days(7)
    .categorize_by_outcome()
    .categorize_by_performance(threshold_percent=20)
    .execute()
2.	Result Object Design
•	Create a comprehensive ComparisonResult class
•	Include all comparison categories with clear access methods
•	Support serialization/deserialization for persistence
3.	Integration with Query
•	Allow seamless transition between Query and Comparison
•	Support using Query results as input to Comparison
•	Maintain session context throughout the pipeline
4. Testing and Documentation
1.	Comprehensive Test Suite
•	Create dedicated test file for comparison functionality
•	Test all comparison categories
•	Test edge cases (empty sessions, all tests changed, etc.)
•	Test with realistic data distributions
2.	Documentation
•	Add detailed documentation for all comparison methods
•	Include examples for common use cases
•	Document the relationship between non-exclusive categories
Next Steps Recommendation
Based on this analysis, I recommend the following concrete next steps:
1.	Design the ComparisonResult class - Define what information should be included in comparison results
2.	Implement the core comparison engine - Focus on reliable session matching and basic categories
3.	Create the fluent interface - Design a clean, chainable API similar to Query
4.	Add advanced categorization - Implement performance, stability, and warning comparisons
5.	Develop comprehensive tests - Create a dedicated test file with thorough coverage
6.	Document the API - Add detailed docstrings and examples




I've expanded the API with several new canned reports and enhanced the parametrization of existing endpoints. Here's a summary of the improvements:
ENHANCED EXISTING ENDPOINTS
1.	Health Report (/api/analysis/health)
•	Added include_trends parameter to optionally exclude trend data
•	Added include_recommendations parameter to control recommendation visibility
•	Added min_score_threshold parameter to only return reports below a certain health score
2.	Stability Report (/api/analysis/stability)
•	Added min_flaky_rate parameter to filter tests by flakiness level
•	Added max_tests parameter to limit the number of returned tests
•	Added include_patterns parameter to control outcome pattern visibility
3.	Performance Report (/api/analysis/performance)
•	Added min_duration parameter to filter by test duration
•	Added max_tests parameter to limit the number of returned tests
•	Added include_trends parameter to control trend data visibility
4.	Comparison Endpoint (/api/compare)
•	Added include_tests parameter to control detailed test result visibility
•	Added min_duration_change parameter to filter performance changes by significance
•	Added include_metrics parameter to include high-level metric comparisons
NEW CANNED REPORTS
1.	Trend Report (/api/analysis/trends)
•	Tracks metrics over time with customizable intervals (day/week/month)
•	Shows duration trends, failure trends, pass rate trends, and test count trends
•	Helps identify patterns and changes in test behavior over time
2.	Coverage Report (/api/analysis/coverage)
•	Analyzes test distribution across modules, packages, or directories
•	Shows coverage by test markers
•	Identifies potentially uncovered areas in the codebase
3.	Regression Report (/api/analysis/regression)
•	Compares recent test runs to a baseline period
•	Identifies new failures, fixed tests, performance regressions, and improvements
•	Provides an overall assessment of the test suite's direction
4.	Quality Report (/api/analysis/quality)
•	Evaluates the test suite design and organization
•	Analyzes test distribution, complexity, and isolation
•	Provides a quality score and actionable recommendations for improvement
These new endpoints provide a comprehensive set of "80/20" reports that cover the most common test analysis needs while still allowing for parametrization to customize the results. The enhanced parametrization gives users more control over the data they receive without requiring them to build complex queries.
Would you like me to explain any of these reports in more detail or add any additional canned reports?
